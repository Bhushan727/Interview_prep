    <h3>Q1. Difference between flex row and column </h3>
    <p>
        <em>Ans. </em>
        In css, flex row and column defines that how elements will display either in major axis or in minor axis.
    when we define the property as flex row it aligns the elements horizontly by default. <br>

    <h3>Q2. Explain inline ,internal and external styleSheet</h3>
    <p>
        <em>Ans. </em>
        inline styleSheet : inline css is type of styling in css, where we defiine css in single line within opening tag of html. The major draw for this type of styling is we have to define css seperately for all tags.
        but this type of css helps us while debugging or checking the code. <br>
        internal StyleSheet: internal css is when we define styles in style tag within the same html page in head section. 
        this type of css has less priority than inline. it is used when we don't want to create new css page so we define in the same html page. <br>
        external StyleSheet : external type of css is most commonly and professionly used type of css.it works by linking a .css file to the html page. it is less complicated to handle the code in exteranl css.
